# Store Search
Store Search is a component you will create that allows a user to search for stores by starting to type in the input field.  As the user types, the API is called to return matching stores.

### Objective
Create component with an input field that allows for a `typeahead` search that is connected to our backend api.  

This project is intentionally vague such that you can accomplish this any way you wish to show off any design or programming creativity. 

### Directions
- Star this Repo 
- Fork this repo to your GitHub
- Clone this repo locally
- Run this project by running the following command: `docker-compose up`

The app should be available in the browser at `http://localhost`

The existing unfiltered API is located at `http://localhost/backend/stores` 

The API backend is written in python and will need to be customized to take the filter that is typed into the text field and return only the matching results.

### Additional Resources / Information
- You may use any existing resources that is available even an existing React component
- You can run on any major OS (MacOS, Windows, Linux) but you will need `Docker` and `docker-compose` working
